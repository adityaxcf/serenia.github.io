# Serenia – Smart City (DAA Course Project)

This project is part of my Design and Analysis of Algorithms course (24ECSP206).  
I designed a small smart-city model called **Serenia** and connected the different 
zones of the city to the algorithms we studied in class.

The website includes:
- My city layout sketches  
- How I used each algorithm in the design  
- A short explanation of the project
