# Serenia – City Design (DAA Course Project)

This is my course project for Design and Analysis of Algorithms (24ECSP206).  
I designed a small smart-city model called **Serenia** and connected the zones of the city  
with basic algorithms we studied in class.

The website includes:
- My city layout sketches  
- How I related different algorithms to city planning  
- A short explanation of the project work

I referred to online material and used ChatGPT only for understanding and formatting.  
Everything else is done by me.
