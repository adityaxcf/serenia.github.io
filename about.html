    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) is a core subject that teaches how 
        to create efficient solutions for computational problems. The course covers 
        major algorithmic strategies including Greedy Methods, Divide and Conquer, 
        Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, Backtracking, and Complexity Analysis.

    <h2>Importance of Algorithms in a Smart City</h2>
    <p>
        Modern smart cities depend heavily on data, automation, and real-time 
        decision-making. Algorithms play a crucial role in systems such as 
        navigation, public transport, energy distribution, water management, 
        emergency routing, healthcare logistics, and security monitoring.
    </p>

    <p>
        By studying these algorithms and understanding their real-world applications, 
        we gain insight into how large-scale interconnected systems like cities are 
        managed efficiently. Serenia City is designed to demonstrate these ideas 
        through zoning, routing, connectivity, and resource optimization.
