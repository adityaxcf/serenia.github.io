<p>
Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) teaches efficient problem-solving through 
structured techniques such as Greedy Algorithms, Divide & Conquer, Dynamic Programming, 
Graph Algorithms, and Complexity Analysis. These concepts are essential in designing 
modern computing systems and intelligent real-world applications.
</p>

<p>
This project applies DAA principles to the functioning of a Smart City named Serenia, 
showcasing how algorithms help optimize routing, utilities, energy, water supply, 
hospital management, and public safety.
