    <h2>What is DAA?</h2>
    <p>
        Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) is a subject that teaches how to solve
        problems efficiently. The main focus is understanding how an algorithm behaves,
        how much time it takes, how much memory it uses and why one approach can be
        better than another.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this course, we learn concepts like time and space complexity, recursion,
        divide and conquer, greedy methods, dynamic programming, hashing, searching,
        sorting and graph algorithms. These topics form the base for problem-solving
        in computer science.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The DAA theory course mainly focuses on analysing efficiencies and applying
        suitable techniques for different types of problems. We study how arrays, graphs,
        trees and different algorithms behave under various inputs.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the end of the course, students should be able to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the purpose and working of algorithm strategies.</li>
        <li>Compare efficiency of multiple algorithms.</li>
        <li>Apply suitable techniques to solve real problems.</li>
        <li>Work with graphs, trees and structured data models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DAA Laboratory Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The lab part of the course helps us implement the algorithms we learn in theory.
        We write programs for searching, sorting, graph traversal, shortest paths and
        operations on trees like AVL or Red-Black Trees.
    </p>
    <p>
        The course also includes a project. For my project, I designed a small smart city
        model named <strong>Serenia</strong> and related each part of the city with
        appropriate algorithms. This helped me connect classroom concepts to practical use.
