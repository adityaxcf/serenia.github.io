<p>
Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) focuses on efficient problem solving using 
algorithmic techniques. Concepts such as Greedy Methods, Divide and Conquer, 
Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, and Complexity Analysis are applied widely 
in real-world systems.
</p>

<p>
This project showcases how these algorithms form the backbone of smart city 
infrastructure — including routing, energy distribution, water networks, 
hospital resource allocation, and public safety.
