    <h2>What is DAA?</h2>
    <p>
        Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) is a foundational subject that teaches how 
        computational problems are solved efficiently. It focuses on algorithmic thinking, 
        performance evaluation, and selecting the best approach among many possible solutions.
        Students learn to measure <strong>time and space complexity</strong>, understand 
        performance trade-offs, and evaluate how algorithms behave on different types of input.
    </p>
    <p>
        Topics covered include recursion, iteration, backtracking, divide and conquer, 
        greedy strategy, dynamic programming, hashing, and graph-based structures such as trees, 
        heaps, and shortest-path algorithms. These concepts form the backbone of modern computer 
        science and real-world applications.

    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The DAA Theory course introduces multiple algorithmic techniques to approach 
        complex problems systematically. Students analyze array queries, sorting and 
        searching algorithms, graph traversal, path finding, and optimization methods.
        The course emphasizes designing solutions that are both correct and efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the end of the course, students are expected to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand properties and applications of algorithmic strategies.</li>
        <li>Compare performance of different algorithms on the same problem.</li>
        <li>Evaluate the efficiency of recursive and iterative solutions.</li>
        <li>Apply suitable design techniques to real-world problems.</li>
        <li>Use graphs, trees, and data structures to model complex systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DAA Laboratory Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Algorithms Lab complements theory by providing hands-on implementation experience.
        Students practice analyzing efficiency, implementing graph algorithms, working with 
        search and sort techniques, and constructing structured data systems.
        The lab also introduces <strong>Fenwick Trees, Sparse Tables, AVL Trees, Red-Black Trees, 
        and shortest-path algorithms</strong> used in advanced computational tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lab concludes with a <strong>Mini Project</strong>, where students apply DAA concepts 
        to a real-world scenario — in this case, the design and analysis of a smart city named 
        <strong>Serenia</strong>. This project bridges theoretical learning with practical 
        implementation and creativity.
