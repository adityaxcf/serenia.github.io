    <h2>What is DAA?</h2>
    <p>
        Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) is a subject that teaches how to solve 
        problems efficiently using different algorithmic techniques. The main idea is 
        to understand how fast an algorithm works, how much memory it uses, and why one 
        method performs better than another.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this course we study topics like time and space complexity, recursion, 
        divide and conquer, greedy approach, dynamic programming, hashing, and graph 
        algorithms. These concepts are the base for problem-solving in computer science.

    <h2>Course Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The DAA theory course focuses on analysing algorithms and applying the 
        right technique based on the type of problem. We learn how searching and 
        sorting work internally, how graphs help us model real-life systems, and 
        how to break larger problems into smaller ones.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the end of the course, students are expected to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Understand the purpose of different algorithm strategies.</li>
        <li>Analyse the efficiency of algorithms for various inputs.</li>
        <li>Choose suitable techniques for real-world problems.</li>
        <li>Work with graphs, trees, and structured data models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DAA Laboratory Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The DAA lab helps us implement the algorithms we learn in theory.  
        We work with searching, sorting, trees, graph traversal, shortest paths,  
        and even some advanced structures like AVL trees and Fenwick trees.
    </p>
    <p>
        The lab also includes a course project. For my project, I designed a smart 
        city model named <strong>Serenia</strong> and connected each part of the city 
        with the appropriate algorithm. This helped me understand how the concepts 
        from the syllabus can be applied in practical situations.
