    <h2>1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Shortest Path Routing</h2>
    <p>
        In Serenia, roads between important zones such as the Residential Area, 
        Mini Hospital, Government Offices, Tech Park, and Transport Hub are 
        modeled as a weighted graph. Dijkstra’s Algorithm is used conceptually 
        to find the shortest path between any two key locations.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ambulances take the fastest route to the hospital during emergencies.</li>
        <li>Fire trucks navigate optimally to fire-prone or dense areas.</li>
        <li>Daily commuters can be guided on the shortest or least congested path.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) – Water & Sewer Networks</h2>
    <p>
        BFS is used to explore unweighted networks level by level. In Serenia, 
        the water pipelines and sewer systems can be visualized as graphs where 
        BFS helps to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check if all residential blocks receive water from the Central Lake.</li>
        <li>Trace how a blockage in a sewer line affects downstream regions.</li>
        <li>Ensure connectivity in the underground utility network.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-2">
    <h2>3. Depth-First Search (DFS) – Security & Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
        DFS is useful for exploring paths deeply before backtracking. In Serenia, 
        DFS can be applied in:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scanning CCTV camera graphs in public squares and markets.</li>
        <li>Exploring building layouts in the Tech Park and Government Zone.</li>
        <li>Tracing suspicious movement across multiple checkpoints.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-3">
    <h2>4. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) – Power & Streetlight Networks</h2>
    <p>
        To reduce infrastructure cost, power lines and streetlight networks can 
        be viewed as a weighted graph. MST algorithms like Prim’s and Kruskal’s 
        help connect all required locations using minimum total cable length.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connecting wind turbines and power stations in the Energy Zone.</li>
        <li>Laying out streetlights covering all main roads with minimal wiring.</li>
        <li>Supplying electricity to all zones while keeping cost under control.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-4">
    <h2>5. Greedy Algorithms – Waste Collection & Patrol Planning</h2>
    <p>
        Greedy strategies make the best local choice at each step to quickly 
        build a good overall solution. In Serenia, they conceptually apply to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choosing the next nearest garbage pickup spot for collection trucks.</li>
        <li>Planning police patrol routes to cover important junctions first.</li>
        <li>Assigning limited resources to the highest priority areas.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-5">
    <h2>6. Divide & Conquer – Zoning and Traffic Segmentation</h2>
    <p>
        The overall complexity of Serenia is reduced by dividing it into zones: 
        Residential, Commercial, Government, Tech Park, Green Belt, and so on. 
        Each zone can be planned separately and later combined into one city.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Breaking traffic flow into smaller subnetworks for analysis.</li>
        <li>Planning construction work region-by-region.</li>
        <li>Handling infrastructure design in stages instead of all at once.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-6">
    <h2>7. Dynamic Programming – Hospital & Resource Management</h2>
    <p>
        Dynamic Programming is used when problems have overlapping subproblems 
        and optimal substructure. In Serenia, it can be applied to:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Optimizing allocation of beds, doctors, and equipment in the Mini Hospital.</li>
        <li>Scheduling emergency vehicles based on demand patterns.</li>
        <li>Planning stock levels for critical medical supplies.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-7">
    <h2>8. Sorting Algorithms – Records and Prioritization</h2>
    <p>
        Sorting is fundamental for organizing data. In Serenia, sorting algorithms 
        can be used for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Arranging property tax records by zone, owner, or due date.</li>
        <li>Sorting service requests or complaints by time or severity.</li>
        <li>Managing lists of vendors, vehicles, and citizens.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-8">
    <h2>9. Hashing – Fast Lookup for IDs & Vehicles</h2>
    <p>
        Hashing enables near constant-time lookup in large datasets. In Serenia, 
        hash tables may be used for:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quick verification of citizen IDs in Government Offices.</li>
        <li>Fast lookup of vehicle registration numbers at checkpoints.</li>
        <li>Maintaining and accessing important records efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
