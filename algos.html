    <h2>1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Shortest Path Routing</h2>
    <p>
        Used for emergency vehicle routing, transport hub optimization, 
        and daily navigation. Roads act as weighted graph edges, allowing 
        the system to find the fastest route.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) – Water & Sewer Network</h2>
    <p>
        BFS helps trace connectivity in pipelines, detect blockages, 
        and ensure even water distribution across Serenia.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. Depth-First Search (DFS) – Security Surveillance</h2>
    <p>
        CCTV network monitoring uses DFS for deep scanning of blocks, 
        tracking suspicious paths or exploring sub-areas fully.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>4. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) – Power & Streetlight Cost Optimization</h2>
    <p>
        MST algorithms (Prim’s/Kruskal’s) minimize cost when connecting 
        power grids, wind turbines, and street lighting systems.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>5. Greedy Algorithms – Waste Collection & Patrol Routes</h2>
    <p>
        Greedy methods help choose optimal local decisions such as 
        shortest waste collection routes and police patrol scheduling.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>6. Divide & Conquer – City Zoning & Traffic Segmentation</h2>
    <p>
        Serenia is divided into functional zones for planning and traffic 
        distribution. Large problems are split into smaller subproblems.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>7. Dynamic Programming – Hospital Resource Management</h2>
    <p>
        DP optimizes medical supply distribution, bed allocation, and 
        emergency scheduling during high demand.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>8. Sorting Algorithms – Market & Government Records</h2>
    <p>
        Sorting helps manage databases like tax records, property data, 
        and market vendor management.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>9. Hashing – Identity, Vehicles & Security Systems</h2>
    <p>
        Hashing allows quick lookup for citizen records, vehicle numbers, 
        and face-recognition systems.
