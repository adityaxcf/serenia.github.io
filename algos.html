    <h2>1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Shortest Paths</h2>
    <p>
        In Serenia, I used the idea of Dijkstra’s algorithm to represent how vehicles 
        would move between important places using the shortest or fastest route.  
        This helps model real systems like navigation, ambulance routing, and emergency movement.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding the quickest path to the hospital.</li>
        <li>Routing between residential areas and commercial zones.</li>
        <li>Reducing travel time in the city network.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>2. BFS – Utility and Service Reachability</h2>
    <p>
        Breadth-First Search is used to check how different areas are connected in terms 
        of services like water supply or waste management. Since BFS works level-by-level, 
        it helps ensure every zone is reachable.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tracing water pipeline flow.</li>
        <li>Ensuring waste collection covers all regions.</li>
        <li>Checking connectivity of basic utilities.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-2">
    <h2>3. DFS – Security and Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
        DFS helps explore deeper paths first. I used this idea for representing how 
        security checks or surveillance systems might scan different parts of the city.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploring CCTV camera paths.</li>
        <li>Checking building-wise scanning routes.</li>
        <li>Inspecting emergency exits and routes.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-3">
    <h2>4. Minimum Spanning Tree – Cost-Effective Connections</h2>
    <p>
        MST concepts helped me understand how to connect different places in the city 
        using minimum cost. This mainly applies to wiring, streetlights, and power lines.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connecting power supply points.</li>
        <li>Planning streetlight wiring.</li>
        <li>Minimising total connection cost.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-4">
    <h2>5. Greedy Approach – Quick Local Decisions</h2>
    <p>
        A greedy method takes the best choice at each step. This fits situations where 
        fast, local decisions are needed in the city.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choosing the next waste pickup point.</li>
        <li>Selecting important roads for patrolling.</li>
        <li>Optimising small tasks during peak hours.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-5">
    <h2>6. Divide & Conquer – Breaking the City into Zones</h2>
    <p>
        I used the idea of dividing the city into smaller regions such as residential, 
        commercial, green belt, tech park, etc. Each zone is planned separately and 
        then combined into a full city.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reducing complexity by handling one zone at a time.</li>
        <li>Managing local traffic independently.</li>
        <li>Simplifying construction and planning.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-6">
    <h2>7. Dynamic Programming – Resource Allocation</h2>
    <p>
        DP helps when a problem has smaller overlapping parts. I used this thinking 
        while planning hospital resources and emergency handling.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Planning bed and staff usage.</li>
        <li>Managing limited medical supplies.</li>
        <li>Handling peak-time emergency requests.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-7">
    <h2>8. Sorting – Organised City Data</h2>
    <p>
        Sorting helps keep records neat and easy to access. In Serenia, I used this 
        concept for maintaining ordered data.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting property details by zone.</li>
        <li>Arranging market vendor lists.</li>
        <li>Prioritising service request queues.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-8">
    <h2>9. Hashing – Fast Lookup</h2>
    <p>
        Hashing allows quick access to information. I related this to situations 
        where fast checking is needed in the city.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vehicle number checking.</li>
        <li>Citizen ID verification.</li>
        <li>Maintaining city records efficiently.</li>
    </ul>
