    <h2>1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Shortest Paths</h2>
    <p>
        In Serenia, I used the idea of Dijkstra’s algorithm to represent how vehicles 
        would move between important places using the shortest or fastest route.  
        This fits real situations like navigation, ambulance routing, and emergency travel.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding the quickest path to the hospital.</li>
        <li>Routing between residential and commercial zones.</li>
        <li>Reducing overall travel time in the city network.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>2. BFS – Utility and Service Reachability</h2>
    <p>
        Breadth-First Search is useful to explore how well different parts of the city 
        are connected in terms of basic services. Since BFS works level by level, it 
        helps ensure that every zone is reachable.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tracing how water supply reaches different areas.</li>
        <li>Planning waste collection coverage.</li>
        <li>Checking if all regions get basic services.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-2">
    <h2>3. DFS – Security and Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
        DFS explores one path deeply before moving to another. I used this idea for 
        representing security checks and monitoring routes in some regions of Serenia.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scanning CCTV camera paths in public spaces.</li>
        <li>Exploring building-wise security routes.</li>
        <li>Inspecting internal movement inside certain zones.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-3">
    <h2>4. Minimum Spanning Tree – Cost-Effective Connections</h2>
    <p>
        MST concepts helped me think about how to connect different locations in the city 
        using minimum cost. This is useful when planning wiring and long connections.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connecting streetlights along the roads.</li>
        <li>Laying power lines between major areas.</li>
        <li>Reducing the total length of connections.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-4">
    <h2>5. Greedy Approach – Quick Local Decisions</h2>
    <p>
        A greedy approach takes the best local choice at each step. I related this idea 
        to cases where fast decisions are needed in the city without doing heavy 
        calculations every time.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choosing the next dustbin or area for garbage pickup.</li>
        <li>Deciding patrolling routes for important roads.</li>
        <li>Taking simple decisions during peak hours.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-5">
    <h2>6. Divide & Conquer – Breaking the City into Zones</h2>
    <p>
        I applied the basic idea of divide and conquer by splitting the city into 
        smaller zones such as residential, commercial, tech park, and green belt.  
        Each zone can be thought of as a subproblem.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Planning one region at a time.</li>
        <li>Managing traffic inside each zone separately.</li>
        <li>Reducing complexity of overall city design.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-6">
    <h2>7. Dynamic Programming – Resource Allocation</h2>
    <p>
        Dynamic Programming is useful when a problem can be split into smaller 
        overlapping parts. I used this idea mainly while thinking about hospital 
        and emergency management.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allocating beds and staff based on demand.</li>
        <li>Managing limited medical supplies properly.</li>
        <li>Handling multiple emergencies in an organised way.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-7">
    <h2>8. Sorting – Organised City Data</h2>
    <p>
        Sorting is a basic concept but very useful in any system that stores data.  
        In Serenia, I imagined sorting being used for maintaining different records.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sorting property records by owner or zone.</li>
        <li>Arranging vendor or shop lists in markets.</li>
        <li>Ordering complaints or service requests by priority.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-8">
    <h2>9. Hashing – Fast Lookup</h2>
    <p>
        Hashing allows quick access to data using keys. I related this to situations 
        where fast checking is important inside the city.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Checking citizen records or IDs quickly.</li>
        <li>Verifying vehicle numbers at certain points.</li>
        <li>Maintaining fast-access internal records.</li>
    </ul>
