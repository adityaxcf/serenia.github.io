    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Serenia is designed as a modern smart city where real-world systems are mapped 
        to core algorithms learned in the Design and Analysis of Algorithms course.
        From transportation and energy to water management and municipal operations, 
        every subsystem of Serenia demonstrates how algorithms enable efficiency, 
        safety, and optimization.

<section>
    <h2>1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Emergency Routing & Transport Hub</h2>
    <p>
        Serenia’s Transport Hub and road network operate on shortest-path logic.
        Dijkstra’s Algorithm ensures:
        <ul>
            <li>Ambulances reach the Mini Hospital in minimum time.</li>
            <li>Fire trucks navigate efficiently around residential blocks.</li>
            <li>Daily commuters receive optimal route suggestions.</li>
            <li>Goods vehicles find cost-efficient delivery paths.</li>
        </ul>
        The algorithm uses weighted edges representing road distances and traffic density.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Breadth-First Search (BFS) – Sewer, Water & Power Grid Connectivity</h2>
    <p>
        BFS helps the municipal team inspect and manage underground pipelines and wiring.
        It is used to:
        <ul>
            <li>Detect blockages in sewer lines by level-wise exploration.</li>
            <li>Trace water flow from the Central Lake to residential zones.</li>
            <li>Check connectivity of energy distribution lines from the Energy Zone.</li>
        </ul>
        BFS is chosen because all edges are unweighted and level-based scanning is required.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>3. Depth-First Search (DFS) – Security Surveillance & Area Scanning</h2>
    <p>
        Serenia’s CCTV and surveillance systems use DFS to:
        <ul>
            <li>Perform deep scans of isolated regions.</li>
            <li>Trace suspicious movement paths.</li>
            <li>Explore building layouts in the Tech Park.</li>
        </ul>
        DFS helps when the goal is to explore complete paths before backtracking.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>4. Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) – Power Line & Water Pipeline Cost Optimization</h2>
    <p>
        Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms reduce infrastructure installation costs.
        They are used in:
        <ul>
            <li>Connecting wind turbines in the Energy Zone at minimum wiring cost.</li>
            <li>Laying water pipelines from the Central Lake to all zones.</li>
            <li>Creating efficient streetlight circuits in the Residential Area (Serenia Residency).</li>
        </ul>
        MST ensures all parts of the city are connected with minimum total edge weight.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>5. Greedy Algorithms – Street Lighting, Patrol Allocation & Waste Routes</h2>
    <p>
        Serenia applies Greedy strategies for tasks requiring quick, local optimization:
        <ul>
            <li>Street-light placement to cover maximum area with minimum poles.</li>
            <li>Garbage truck routes for fast collection from Residential & Market areas.</li>
            <li>Police patrol routes in the Government Zone for maximum coverage.</li>
        </ul>
        Greedy choices ensure fast and practical real-time decisions.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Divide and Conquer – Land Zoning & Traffic Load Distribution</h2>
    <p>
        Divide and Conquer supports city planners in:
        <ul>
            <li>Splitting Serenia into Residential, Commercial, Industrial, and Green Belt zones.</li>
            <li>Dividing road traffic into smaller subnetworks to avoid congestion.</li>
            <li>Optimizing construction scheduling in the Tech Park.</li>
        </ul>
        The approach helps manage complexity by breaking tasks into manageable parts.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>7. Dynamic Programming – Hospital Resources & Emergency Supply Chains</h2>
    <p>
        The Mini Hospital and disaster management units use DP to:
        <ul>
            <li>Allocate beds, doctors, and equipment during peak hours.</li>
            <li>Optimize medical supply routes from pharmacies to the hospital.</li>
            <li>Predict and handle seasonal demand for utilities.</li>
        </ul>
        DP helps when overlapping subproblems and optimal substructures exist.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>8. Sorting Algorithms – Market Data, Tax Records & Inventory</h2>
    <p>
        Sorting is essential in multiple areas of Serenia:
        <ul>
            <li>Sorting vendor lists in the Market & Town Square.</li>
            <li>Sorting municipal tax records by property ID.</li>
            <li>Arranging hospital patient data by severity.</li>
        </ul>
        Efficient sorting improves lookup time and data processing speed.
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>9. Hashing – Vehicle, Citizen & Security Databases</h2>
    <p>
        Serenia maintains fast-access data systems using hash tables:
        <ul>
            <li>Vehicle registration lookup at checkpoints.</li>
            <li>Citizen ID verification in Government Offices.</li>
            <li>High-speed face-recognition used in the Security Zone.</li>
        </ul>
        Hashing ensures constant-time (O(1)) data access.
    </p>

<section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Serenia demonstrates how algorithmic thinking powers modern urban systems. 
        Every component of the city—from transportation to utilities—relies on 
        DAA principles to function efficiently, safely, and cost-effectively.
