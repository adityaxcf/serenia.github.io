    <h2>1. Dijkstra’s Algorithm – Shortest Paths</h2>
    <p>
        In Serenia, I used the idea of Dijkstra’s algorithm to represent how vehicles
        would move between important places using the shortest or fastest route.
        This fits real situations like navigation, ambulance routing and emergency travel.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Finding the quickest path to the hospital.</li>
        <li>Routing between residential and commercial zones.</li>
        <li>Reducing overall travel time in the city network.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>2. BFS – Utility and Service Reachability</h2>
    <p>
        Breadth-First Search is useful to explore how well different parts of the city
        are connected in terms of basic services. Since BFS works level by level, it
        helps ensure that every zone is reachable.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tracing how water supply reaches different areas.</li>
        <li>Planning waste collection coverage.</li>
        <li>Checking if all regions get basic services.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-2">
    <h2>3. DFS – Security and Monitoring</h2>
    <p>
        DFS explores one path deeply before moving to another. I used this idea for
        representing security checks and monitoring routes in some regions of Serenia.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scanning CCTV routes in public spaces.</li>
        <li>Exploring building-wise security checks.</li>
        <li>Inspecting internal paths or escape routes.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

    <h2>4. Minimum Spanning Tree – Cost-Effective Connections</h2>
    <p>
        MST concepts helped me think about how to connect different locations in the city
        using minimum cost. This is useful when planning wiring and long connections.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Connecting streetlights along the roads.</li>
        <li>Laying power lines between zones.</li>
        <li>Reducing the total length of connections.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-4">
    <h2>5. Greedy Approach – Quick Local Decisions</h2>
    <p>
        A greedy approach takes the best local choice at each step. I related this idea
        to cases where fast decisions are needed in the city without doing heavy
        calculations every time.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Choosing the next dustbin or area for garbage pickup.</li>
        <li>Deciding patrolling routes for important roads.</li>
        <li>Handling simple decisions during peak hours.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-5">
    <h2>6. Divide & Conquer – Splitting the City into Zones</h2>
    <p>
        I applied the basic idea of divide and conquer by splitting the city into
        smaller zones such as residential, commercial, tech park and green belt.
        Each zone can be thought of as a subproblem.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Planning one region at a time.</li>
        <li>Managing traffic inside each zone separately.</li>
        <li>Reducing the complexity of overall city design.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="card fade-in delay-6">
    <h2>7. Dynamic Programming, Sorting and Hashing</h2>
    <p>
        Dynamic Programming was used in my thinking for resource allocation, especially
        in hospital and emergency cases. Sorting and hashing ideas were linked to how
        city data and records can be stored neatly and accessed quickly.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Allocating beds and staff based on demand.</li>
        <li>Sorting records like properties or vendors.</li>
        <li>Fast lookups using hashing for IDs or vehicles.</li>
    </ul>
