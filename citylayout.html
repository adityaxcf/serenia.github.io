    <h2>Layout 1 – Main Zoning Map</h2>
    <p>
        This is the first zoning sketch I made for Serenia. I placed the main areas like 
        residential, commercial, hospital, tech park, and government offices in simple 
        positions so that the structure is easy to understand. This layout helped me decide 
        how movement and services would connect between different parts of the city.

    <h2>Layout 2 – Notes and Planning</h2>
    <p>
        This page contains my handwritten notes where I planned land usage, placement of 
        important zones, and rough measurements. These notes helped me finalise the overall 
        layout before connecting algorithms to the city design.
