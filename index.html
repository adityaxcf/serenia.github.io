        <p>
            Serenia is a small conceptual smart city model that I designed as part of my DAA course project.
            The main idea is to take the algorithms from the DAA syllabus and connect them to different
            parts of a city such as roads, services, and resource management.
        </p>
        <p>
            I divided the city into zones like residential area, commercial zone, hospital, government offices,
            tech park, green belt, and transport hub. After deciding the zones, I related each of them to
            suitable algorithms such as Dijkstra’s, BFS, DFS, Minimum Spanning Tree, greedy methods,
            and dynamic programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            I referred to online resources for better understanding and used ChatGPT mainly for clarification
            and formatting support. The planning, sketches, layout decisions and explanations were done by me
            based on my understanding of the course.

                <h3>Main Zoning Map</h3>
                <p>
                    The first layout shows the main zoning sketch of Serenia. I placed key areas like
                    residential, commercial, hospital, tech park, government offices, green belt and
                    transport hub in a simple and understandable structure. This helped me visualise
                    how people and services would move between these regions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While drawing this, I kept in mind which zones would be connected frequently, where
                    emergency access is important, and which paths should be shorter or more direct.
                    This later helped when linking the city to algorithms like shortest path and MST.

                <h3>Planning Notes and Details</h3>
                <p>
                    The second layout page contains my handwritten notes. Here I planned land usage,
                    rough measurements, zone placement and some reasoning behind keeping certain
                    areas next to each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These notes were useful when finalising the structure of Serenia and made it
                    easier to write explanations for the project. They also helped me think about
                    where algorithms like greedy methods or dynamic programming might fit in
                    when dealing with limited resources or repeated decisions.

        <h3>Design and Analysis of Algorithms</h3>
        <p>
            Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) is a subject that teaches how to solve
            problems efficiently. It focuses on how an algorithm behaves for different inputs,
            how much time it takes, how much memory it uses, and why one method can be better
            than another.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this course we learn time and space complexity, recursion, divide and conquer,
            greedy methods, dynamic programming, hashing, searching, sorting and basic graph
            algorithms. These topics form an important part of problem-solving in computer science.
        </p>

        <h3>Lab Work and Project</h3>
        <p>
            In the DAA lab, we implement many of these algorithms as programs and observe how
            they behave with different kinds of input. We work with searching, sorting, tree
            operations, graph traversal and shortest path problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the lab, I chose to design Serenia as my course project. Mapping the
            algorithms to a smart city model helped me clearly understand where these concepts
            can appear in real situations instead of only in theory or coding problems.
