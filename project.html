    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        Serenia is a conceptual smart city designed as an individual project for 
        the Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) course. The purpose of this 
        project is to understand how theoretical algorithmic concepts can be applied 
        to real-world systems such as city planning, routing, public services, and 
        utility management.
    </p>

    <p>
        I began by sketching the structure of the city, deciding on the placement 
        of major zones such as Residential Areas, Commercial Blocks, Government 
        Offices, Mini Hospital, Tech Park, Energy & Industrial Zone, and Green Belt. 
        The goal was to create a layout where algorithmic ideas naturally fit into 
        the city’s functional requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
        Since I am still learning these concepts, I referred to online study 
        resources and also used ChatGPT as a learning tool to understand how 
        algorithms such as Dijkstra’s, BFS, MST, and Dynamic Programming relate 
        to real-world systems. The final design, structure, explanations, and 
        connections across zones are entirely my own work, supported by these 
        external references for clarity and improvement.

    <h2>City Design – Layout 1 (Zoning Map)</h2>
    <p>
        This layout represents the main zoning structure of Serenia City. It includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Residential Zones</li>
        <li>Commercial and Market Areas</li>
        <li>Government and Administrative Block</li>
        <li>Mini Hospital and Healthcare Facilities</li>
        <li>Tech Park and Industrial/Energy Zones</li>
        <li>Central Lake and Green Belt Area</li>
        <li>Transport Hub and Connecting Roads</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These placements were chosen to maximize connectivity and visualize the mapping 
        of algorithms such as shortest path routing, resource allocation, and network 
        connectivity.

    <h2>City Design – Layout 2 (Notes & Planning Details)</h2>
    <p>
        The second layout includes handwritten notes and a breakdown of land 
        distribution among various zones. It highlights important planning decisions 
        such as:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Relative proportions of residential vs. commercial areas</li>
        <li>Positioning of essential services like hospitals, police, and transport</li>
        <li>Functional justification of each zone’s location</li>
        <li>Infrastructure flow including roads, utilities, and green spaces</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These notes played a crucial role in refining the layout and establishing 
        logical connections that align with algorithmic concepts explored in the 
        next sections of the project.
