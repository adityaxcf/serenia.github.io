    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        Serenia is a conceptual smart city designed as part of the 
        Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) Mini Project. 
        The goal of this project was to understand how various 
        algorithmic concepts can be applied to real-life city 
        planning, routing, public services, and infrastructure.
        Since this was an individual project, all design, planning, 
        layout sketching, and algorithm mapping were done by me.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the creation of Serenia, I studied different zones a 
        modern city requires—such as residential, commercial, 
        educational, government, health, energy, and transport hubs—
        and structured them in a way where algorithmic connections 
        become clear and meaningful. The layouts below show how the 
        city was planned and later analyzed using DAA concepts.
    </p>

    <p>
        As I am still learning these concepts, I referred to online 
        resources and used ChatGPT as a tool to better understand how 
        algorithms like Dijkstra’s, MST, BFS, and Dynamic Programming 
        could be practically mapped to city systems. This guidance 
        helped me refine the structure and presentation of the project, 
        while the conceptual understanding and final implementation 
        are entirely my own.

    <h2>City Design – Layout 1 (Zoning Map)</h2>
    <p>
        This main layout shows the zoning plan of Serenia City. 
        It includes Residential Areas, Commercial Zones, Transport Hub, 
        Green Belt, Lake, Government Offices, Tech Park, Energy Sector, 
        and Industrial Regions. The arrangement allows algorithms to be 
        mapped naturally—for example, shortest path routing between 
        critical zones, MST for power distribution, and BFS for utility networks.

    <h2>City Design – Layout 2 (Notes & Land Distribution)</h2>
    <p>
        This page contains my handwritten notes of city planning, 
        including land percentage distribution, zoning justification, 
        and design reasoning. It highlights how Serenia was structured 
        to support the DAA-based analysis. These notes helped outline 
        practical connections between the city’s physical layout and 
        the algorithms explained in the next sections.
