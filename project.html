    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        For my DAA course project, I designed a small smart city model named 
        <strong>Serenia</strong>. The goal was to relate different parts of the city with the
        algorithms we studied in class. This helped me understand how these concepts
        can be applied to real-world planning.
    </p>
    <p>
        I divided the city into zones such as residential, commercial, hospital, 
        government offices, tech park, green belt, and transport hub. After deciding 
        the layout, I matched each zone or function with a suitable algorithm like 
        Dijkstra’s, BFS, DFS, MST, greedy method, and dynamic programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        I used online sources when needed to clarify concepts and used ChatGPT for 
        formatting support, but the layout, sketches, and explanations were prepared 
        by me based on my understanding of the course.

    <h2>City Design – Layout 1 (Zoning)</h2>
    <p>
        This is the main zoning layout of Serenia. It shows how I arranged the major 
        areas of the city in a simple structure. This sketch made it easier to decide 
        how services and movement would work between zones.

    <h2>City Design – Layout 2 (Notes & Planning)</h2>
    <p>
        This page contains my handwritten notes where I planned the land distribution, 
        placement of important zones, and basic measurements. These notes helped me 
        finalise the structure before writing the explanation.
