    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        For my DAA course project, I designed a small smart city model called 
        <strong>Serenia</strong>. The main idea was to take the algorithms we study in class 
        and connect them to real city requirements like roads, utilities, emergency movement, 
        services, and overall planning. This helped me understand where each algorithm is 
        actually useful.
    </p>
    <p>
        I created a basic layout by dividing the city into zones like residential, commercial, 
        government offices, hospital, tech park, transport hub, green belt, and energy areas. 
        After finalizing the zones, I tried to relate each part of the city with a suitable 
        algorithm from the DAA syllabus such as shortest path, MST, BFS/DFS, greedy approach, 
        and dynamic programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        I referred to online materials whenever I needed clarity and also used ChatGPT only 
        for understanding certain topics better and organising my work. The diagrams, planning, 
        layout decisions, and explanations were done by me based on what I understood from the course.

    <h2>City Design – Layout 1 (Main Zoning)</h2>
    <p>
        This is the first draft of my city layout. Here I marked all major zones and kept them 
        in a simple structure so that the city is easy to understand and analyse.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Residential Area</li>
        <li>Commercial Zone</li>
        <li>Government Offices</li>
        <li>Mini Hospital</li>
        <li>Tech Park</li>
        <li>Green Belt & Central Lake</li>
        <li>Transport Hub</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        I also thought about how people, vehicles, and services will move between these zones so 
        that the algorithm explanation becomes easier later.

    <h2>City Design – Layout 2 (Notes & Planning)</h2>
    <p>
        The second page contains my handwritten notes. I used this page to plan land usage, 
        percentage distribution, placement of important services, and how different parts of 
        the city connect with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        These notes helped me finalise the idea and gave me a proper base for linking the 
        algorithms in the next stage of the project.
